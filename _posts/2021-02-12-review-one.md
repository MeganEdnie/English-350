# Review: The Garden of Earthly Delights

### Project: Jheronimus Bosch, The Garden of Earthly Delights

### Project Director: Pieter van Huijstee

This website takes the viewer on a tour through the Garden of Earthly Delights triptych (ca. 1500), by Jheronimus Bosch. A triptych is a painting on three panels. The painting itself exclaims the intricacies of both good and bad sin. It delves deeply into that world, displayed differently within each panel. The painting is brought to life on the website, able to be viewed by those who are fans of either Bosch or art in general. 

The Bosch project is supported by the Dutch television network NPO2 and fonds21, a fund created for the advancement of art and culture for the youth. While the supporters are listed, it is very difficult to locate the programming interface behind the website. In order to understand the creation of this website, it would be beneficial to have this information more forthcoming. Regardless, the creation of this resource exposes this complex art piece to a much broader digital audience.

Before embarking on the journey that is the interactive documentary of Bosch’s painting, a description box appears with a brief explanation of what lies ahead. There are both audio and visual aspects to the tour immersing the viewer into the painting as an experience rather than a two dimensional painting. Offering both a self-guided tour and highlight tour the visitor is able to choose whether they would like to browse alone or follow a guided tour.

One tour option is the highlight tour. This tour overviews the painting’s story through 15 specific scenes. These are selected amongst the possible 50  that are offered in self-guided. While the highlight tour does cover the story it only features these certain parts of the painting thus creating plot holes in the complete visual experience. Nonetheless, it gives a broad enough overview to familiarize the viewer with the painting if they then choose to freely explore more in depth.

Regarding the self-guided tour, any section of the triptych is able to be selected. Then the frame zooms in and the narrator begins to explain the scene’s context. Accompanying the scene, is additional music or sound to further enhance the mood of each busy section. This tour is free of any direction, with no suggested order to follow. If one wished to understand the triptych’s story the way Bosch intended, they would have to first review it elsewhere. This may negate the purpose of visiting the site because it creates more work for the viewer. Although, this self-guided version is akin to walking around a museum without a tour and allows the viewer to interpret the painting in their own unique way. Not everyone wants to be restricted to a tour and the Bosch project understands and provides that as an option.

The way the project flows along with the paired voiceover provides a great explanation of what is transpiring in the specific scene. Although, the website only provides an English and Dutch translation limiting the scope of people able to fully access the tour. With the project originating in the Netherlands, even the initial pop-up to allow cookies is strictly in Dutch. If there were to be a wider range of voiceover languages and website translations, more art enthusiasts from around the world would be able to utilize this documentary.

Despite this language barrier, the project is multi-faceted employing several digital platforms that attract the viewer. Voiceover, additional audio overlay, clear visuals and on screen text to follow along are all provided simultaneously. The music does begin automatically and the option to turn it on could be valuable. If one were to get overwhelmed, the audio can be muted, text can be minimized and the voiceover can be manually paused and played. This displays that the website developers thought about the possible annoyances with a convergence of so many features and gave options to lessen them.

Overall, the Bosch project does a great job of bringing this piece of art to life. It makes it accessible to those who are not able to see it in person at the Museo Nacional del Prado in Spain. It also provides an informative synopsis of the historical background and context that would influence Bosch at the time. With all of this, viewers are able to learn so much more about this painting all in one resource.
