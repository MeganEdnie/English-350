# Hello, my name is Megan Ednie!

I am a senior Marketing Major and Leadership Studies Minor at CNU. My preferred pronouns are she/her/hers. Entering my last semester, I still needed to complete a Writing Intensive. After looking at all the possible options I decided upon Writing for the Digital Humanities due to previous interest. I considered minoring in DH my sophomore year but was not ever able to due to my schedule and course load. I am always looking to improve my writing and while I am not directly pursuing a career in writing I feel like it is a wonderful skill to have in the workplace. 

Once I graduate I am looking forward to immediately entering the workforce. I do think I could eventually see myself going to graduate school, but would like to obtain some real world experience first. I am currently interning with an automotive marketing company called [Team Velocity](https://teamvelocitymarketing.com). I have been with them since the summer of 2019 and have continued working with them during my breaks. I was very fortunate to be able to work with them even throughout the throes of the pandemic. I would like to continue my professional career with them following graduation.

While I do have this initial plan, my dream is to move to New York to pursue a job as a marketing director of a clothing or social media company. Something like the comapny [Cider](https://shopcider.com/?utm_source=google_search&gclid=CjwKCAiAgc-ABhA7EiwAjev-j9Rf52SBFp1Ohs8axTi9_kMnX9lqxHLqYkVxxrmKE0PS-mt8919qaRoC9SIQAvD_BwE) or even [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com) would be an ultimate goal I ultimately want to be working within an industry that I am more knowledgable and interested in. However, I am realisitic in realising New York is expensive and I will have to save money before I can take that leap.

To conclude, I am originally from Northern Virginia and will most likely be returning there after graduation. I have a dog named MacKenzie and I have no idea what breed she is. Regarding hobbies, I have recently gotten back into knitting (only scarfs) and baking cakes (poorly). Other than that, I love going out on day trips or out to eat with my friends and family. If you are ever in Leesburg, consider checking out [South Street Under](https://www.southstreetunder.com) it is my favorite!
