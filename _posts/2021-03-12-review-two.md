**Summary** 

Selfiecity is an integrative look into the breakdown of selfies from around the world. Focusing on the cities Bangkok, Berlin, Moscow, New York and Sao Paulo and citing that each city displays a different selfie style. In order to produce this large of a project, selfiecity was supported by The Graduate Center, City University of New York, California Institute for Telecommunication and Information, and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Selfiecity worked with the research and design studio OFFC as well as gnip for data collection. Using that selfie data, the team was able to analyze poses, head tilt, gender and age profile and smile distribution through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk Workers.

**Data Collection Process**

These Mechanical Turk Workers perform “virtual tasks that require human intelligence” (link). The data is collected via random photo selection  from Instagram and were tagged if they showed a single selfie. The top 1000 photos tagged by 2 or more Turk Workers were then selected and the age and gender were verified by the Master Workers. The selfiecity team then ran an algorithm that analyzed each face and the photos were manually viewed and further narrowed to 640 selfies for each city. 

**Website Organization**

The website is organized by project introduction, imageplots, selfiexploratory (a page to interact with the collected data), the dataset, findings, theoretical writeups, credits and further exploration into the topic. When initially accessing the website, it is not apparent that all website content is on a single scrollable page. As I maneuvered through the menu bar I thought it was bringing me to a different web page as I clicked each header. In actuality, the menu works to move the viewer up and down the page. This does not pose too much difficulty but, the way information runs together rather than being separated amongst tabs, can be confusing. Regardless, the information flows together in an order that makes sense both aesthetically and informationally. 

Visually, if the website is in split screen, the menu transitions from a bar at the top to a dropdown. This dropdown obstructs half of the screen and has to be manually closed by selecting the three line box. There is no other way to close out of the menu. This could be remedied by allowing lack of interaction or clicking out of the menu to minimize it. When in full screen mode, it is easily located at the top and does not cover the screen in an imposing way. There most likely is not a better way to formulate the menu for smaller screens, so it does make sense why it had to transform into drop down.

The “Imageplots” section is where all the data comes to life and the viewer is able to see an interactive breakdown of all the selfies. Under “Poses” you are able to filter selfies based on city or photo orientation. Once the selfies are filtered there is no option to expand any of those selfies. Scrolling further down the rest of the data is divided into scatterplot graphs. Each tiny dot represents a tiny selfie. When selecting each point on the graph, the selfie will expand. This becomes an issue if the viewer decides to select a selfie towards the top. If they do, the selfie is cut off and in some instances you cannot even see the face. Fortunately, they created the “selfiexploratory” section that allows the viewer to filter the selfies in any way they choose. Selfieploratory lets you expand each selfie after filtering and centers the selfie in the screen so there are no odd crops.

**Conclusion**

Overall, selfiecity is a very unique take on social media and the way that it can be further analyzed. While there are some critiques with the website set up and application, it serves an interesting purpose. Selfiecity teaches us about the vastly different norms around the world when it comes to selfies. It would be very compelling to see them continue this project past 2014 and reflect on changes in the way people take selfies.
