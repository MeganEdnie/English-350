# The Digitization of "The Yellow Wall-paper"

The purpose of the past two weeks has been for our class to collectively digitize ”The Yellow Wall-paper” written by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. This short story details a woman battling what is now known as postpartum depression. It shows the extreme detriments of strict gender roles, bringing to light the issues women faced in the late 19th century. We worked to transform her manuscript into digital form through Text Coding Initiative (TEI) whilst using Extensible Markup Language (XML).  

After familiarizing ourselves on the importance of marking up text, and reviewing the basics of TEI in Oxygen, we began the encoding process. Dr. Stover directed us to the “Transcriptions” folder in our shared google drive. In this folder, we found the text we were to annotate and I was assigned pages 48 through 51. In order to help my future self, I made a multitude of comments indicating places I saw weird spacing, underlined words, crossed out letters, etc.  This way when we moved on to Oxygen, I would know what features to encode.

When we first started using Oxygen, the XML tags seemed daunting with this being an entirely new subject for me. Like Annette Vee said in her “Programming as Literacy” chapter, “the parallels between programming and writing are quite apt” (2017). It truly was understanding a different language. I have only taken one coding course prior to this semester and we coded in R. R is a very different programming language, so it was not a beneficial prerequisite to using the Oxygen platform.

I tried to follow along in class but found it difficult to both learn about Oxygen and work in it simultaneously. I was grateful that Dr. Stover recorded the direction part of her lecture for later viewing purposes. After my first Oxygen attempt, my computer froze when I went to save, causing me to lose all prior work. This put me at a disadvantage during our TEI Troubleshooting class, as I had no code completed and was not able to ask questions.

Once I was able to follow along with the video and continuously save my work, everything became so much more clear. I was able to markup the text line by line using my comments in Google Docs. The markup process became enjoyable and every time my code validated I felt a sense of pride. It was fulfilling to go into Oxygen’s Author view and see Stetson's manuscript in a digital format. Knowing I was able to contribute to this collaborative DH project while familiarizing myself with this work of Charlotte Stetson was an enjoyable experience.
