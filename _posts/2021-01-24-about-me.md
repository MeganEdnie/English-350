# Hello, my name is Megan Ednie!
![Alt Text](https://github.com/MeganEdnie/English-350/blob/main/images/Profile.jpg)
I am a senior Marketing Major and Leadership Studies Minor at CNU. My preferred pronouns are she/her/hers. Entering my last semester, I still need to complete a Writing Intensive. After looking at all the possible options I decided upon Writing for the Digital Humanities due to my interest. I considered minoring in DH my sophomore year but was not ever able to due to my schedule and course load. I am always looking to improve my writing and while I am not directly pursuing a career in writing I feel like it is a wonderful skill to have in the workplace. 

Once I graduate I am looking forward to immediately entering the workforce. I do think I could eventually see myself going to graduate school, but would like to obtain some real world experience first. I am currently interning with an automotive marketing company called [Team Velocity](https://teamvelocitymarketing.com). I have been with them since the summer of 2019 and have continued working with them during my breaks. I was very fortunate to continue working with them even in the throes of the pandemic. I would like to begin my professional career with them following graduation.

While I do have an initial plan, I do dream of moving to New York and pursuing a job as a marketing director of a clothing or social media company. I ultimately want to be working within an industry that I am more knowledgable and interested in. However, I am realisitic in realising New York is expensive and I will have to save money before I can take that leap.

To conclude, I am originally from Northern Virginia and will most likely be returning their post-undergrad. I have a dog named McKenzie and I have no idea what breed she is. I have recently gotten back into knitting (only scarfs I am a novice) and baking cakes (also not good). Other than that, I love going out on day trips or to eat with my friends and family. If you are ever in Leesburg, consider checking out [South Street Under](https://www.southstreetunder.com) it is my favorite!
