### **Project:** Jheronimus Bosch, The Garden of Earthly Delights

This website takes the viewer on a tour through The Garden of Earthly Delights triptych, which is a painting on three different connected panels, by Jheronimus Bosch. The painting itself exclaims the intricacies of both good and bad in the world. It delves deeply into the world displayed differently in each panel. The painting is clearly exhibited on the website, able to be viewed by those who are fans of either Bosch or art in general. The Bosch project is supported by the Dutch television network NPO2 and fonds21, a fund created for the advancement of art and culture for the youth. While the supporters are listed, it is very difficult to locate the programming interface behind the website. In order to understand the creation of this website, it would be beneficial to have this information more forthcoming.

Before embarking on the journey that is an “interactive documentary” of Jheronimus Bosch’s painting, a description box appears with a brief explanation of what lies ahead. There are both audio and visual aspects to the tour immersing the viewer into the painting as an experience rather than a two dimensional painting. Offering both a self-guided tour and highlight tour the visitor is able to choose whether they would like to browse alone or follow a guided tour.

For the self-guided tour, any section of the triptych is able to be selected, the frame zooms in closer, and the narrator begins to explain the scene’s context. Accompanying the scene, is additional music or sound to further enhance the mood of the busy piece of art. The self guided tour is completely free of any direction and there is no suggested order to follow. If one wished to understand the triptych’s story the way Bosch intended, they would have to review it elsewhere first. This may negate the purpose of visiting the site because it creates more work for the viewer. Although, this tour version is akin to walking around a museum without a tour and allows the viewer to interpret the painting in their own unique way. Not everyone wants to be restricted to a tour and the Bosch project understands and provides that as an option.

The other tour option is the “highlight tour” that overviews the painting’s story through 15 specific scenes that are selected amongst the possible 50 that are offered in self-guided. While the highlight tour does cover the story it only features these certain parts of the painting thus creating plot holes in the complete visual experience. Nonetheless, it does give a broad enough overview to familiarize the viewer with the painting if they then choose to freely explore more in depth.

The way the project flows along with the paired voiceover provides a great explanation of what is transpiring in the specific scene. Although, the website only provides an English and Dutch translation limiting the scope of people able to fully access the tour. With the project originating from the Netherlands, even the initial pop-up to allow cookies is strictly in Dutch. If there were to be a wider range of voiceover languages and website translations, more art enthusiasts from all around the world would be able to access this documentary. Despite the language barrier for some, this project is multi-faceted utilizing several digital platforms that can attract the viewer. Voiceover, additional audio overlay, clear visuals and on screen text to follow along are all provided simultaneously. If one were to get overwhelmed, the audi can be muted, text can be minimized and the voiceover can be manually paused and played. This shows the website developers thought about the possible annoyances with a convergence of so many features and gave options to lessen them.
